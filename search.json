    "section": "",
    "text": "The question everyone is asking is, would Mac Jones be able to continue the winning tradition in New England?\nJones started his career hot by taking the Patriots to the playoffs with a 10-7 record and having the thirteenth most yards in the NFL with 3801, just nine yards shy of twelfth. The Patriots would get stomped by Buffalo Bills in the Wildcard round. Jones’ season would end there, but Patriot fans all around looked forward to next year.\n2022 would not start so hot for Jones when he suffered a high ankle sprain just three games into the season. Mac wouldn’t see the field until week seven, where he was benched after just six passed and replaced by rookie quarterback Bailey Zappe. Jones would start week eight and not look back. Since then, the Patriots are 3-2 with Jones under center.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nne21 <- read_csv(\"MacJones2021.csv\") %>% mutate(season = \"2021\")\nne22 <- read_csv(\"MacJones2022.csv\")%>% mutate(season = \"2022\")\nnfl2021 <- read_csv(\"MacJones2021.csv\") %>% mutate(season = \"2021\")\nnfl2022 <- read_csv(\"MacJones2022.csv\") %>% mutate(season = \"2022\")\njones21 <- read_csv(\"MacJones2021.csv\")\njones22 <- read_csv(\"MacJones2022.csv\")\n\nne21clean <- ne21 %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\nne22clean <- ne22 %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\nnfl2022clean <- nfl2022 %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\nnfl2021clean <- nfl2021 %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\njonesclean <- jones21 %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\njonesclean <- jones22 %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\n\ncombined1 <- bind_rows(ne21clean, ne22clean) %>% \n  filter(Yds...12 > 800) %>% filter(Players != \"Joe Flacco\" &  Players != \"Mike White\" &  Players != \"Tyrod Taylor\" &  Players != \"Cooper Rush\" &  Players != \"Tyler Huntley\" &  Players != \"Trevor Siemian\" &  Players != \"Marcus Mariota\" &  Players != \"Sam Darnold\" &  Players != \"Geno Smith\" &  Players != \"Teddy Bridgewater\" &  Players != \"Ben Roethlisberger\" & Players != \"Taysom Hill\" & Players != \"Kenny Pickett\") \ncombined2 <- bind_rows(nfl2022clean, nfl2021clean)\n\nnewcombined <- combined2 %>% \n  filter(Att > 100) %>% filter(season == \"2022\" | season == \"2021\") %>% \n  group_by(season, Players) %>%\n  summarise(CmpPercent = sum(`Cmp%`)/ 100) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from=season, values_from = CmpPercent) %>% \n  mutate(PercentChange = (`2022` - `2021`))%>%\narrange(desc(PercentChange)) %>% \n  top_n(32)\n\ndiff <- jonesclean %>% \n  group_by(Players) %>% \n  summarise(\n    TotalTouchdowns = sum(TD),\n    TotalInterceptions = sum(Int)\n  ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(TotalTouchdowns)) %>% \n  filter(TotalTouchdowns > 8)\n\ndiff2 <- jonesclean %>% \n  group_by(Players) %>% \n  summarise(\n    TotalTouchdowns = sum(TD),\n    TotalInterceptions = sum(Int)\n  ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(TotalTouchdowns)) %>% \n  filter(TotalTouchdowns > 5)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5569, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data=combined1, aes(x=reorder(Players, Yds...12), weight=Yds...12, fill=season)) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=14, y=6000, label=\"5569\"), color=\"navy\", size = 3.2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    labels = c(\"2021 Total Yards\", \"2022 Total Yards\"),\n    values = c(\"navy\", \"red\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"For a pocket passer, Mac Jones is quite low in passing yards in 2022\",\n    subtitle = \"With only six games left of the season, he would have to average 300 yards a game to be where Mahomes is now.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By: Reed Johannsen\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Total Yards\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his rookie year, Mac Jones would hold the second-highest completion percentage of all rookie quarterbacks behind Cowboy’s Dak Prescott. Many Mac and Patriot haters dismissed this statistic because Jones would only throw check-down passes, even though he averaged 10.8 yards per completion.\nSeems like fans like to dislike Jones based off the fact that he plays for the Patriots.\nSo far, Jones has a higher completion percentage this year in 2022, by 1.6 percent. Could this be because he has only played eight of twelve games this year? Contrary to popular belief, through his first eight games of 2021 and 2022, Jones still has a higher completion percentage in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nnewcombined %>% gt() %>% \n   cols_label(\n    PercentChange = \"Percent Change\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Has Mac Jones surpassed his sophomore slump?\",\n    subtitle = \"Even though he has completed less passes, Jones has a higher completion percentage in 2022.\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**Source:** Sports Reference | **By:** Reed Johannsen\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")   %>%\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(PercentChange, `2021`, `2022`),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"navy\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"red\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Players == \"Mac Jones\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Has Mac Jones surpassed his sophomore slump?\n    \n    \n      Even though he has completed less passes, Jones has a higher completion percentage in 2022.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Players\n      2021\n      2022\n      Percent Change\n    \n  \n  \n    Trevor Lawrence\n59.6%\n66.5%\n6.9%\n    Jalen Hurts\n61.3%\n67.3%\n6.0%\n    Jameis Winston\n59.0%\n63.5%\n4.5%\n    Andy Dalton\n63.1%\n66.4%\n3.3%\n    Matt Ryan\n67.0%\n69.2%\n2.2%\n    Tua Tagovailoa\n67.8%\n69.7%\n1.9%\n    Mac Jones\n67.6%\n69.2%\n1.6%\n    Justin Herbert\n65.9%\n67.4%\n1.5%\n    Jacoby Brissett\n62.7%\n64.1%\n1.4%\n    Matthew Stafford\n67.2%\n68.0%\n0.8%\n    Justin Fields\n58.9%\n59.6%\n0.7%\n    Josh Allen\n63.3%\n63.9%\n0.6%\n    Daniel Jones\n64.3%\n64.6%\n0.3%\n    Zach Wilson\n55.6%\n55.6%\n0.0%\n    Patrick Mahomes\n66.3%\n66.1%\n−0.2%\n    Carson Wentz\n62.4%\n62.1%\n−0.3%\n    Dak Prescott\n68.8%\n68.1%\n−0.7%\n    Jimmy Garoppolo\n68.3%\n67.4%\n−0.9%\n    Kirk Cousins\n66.3%\n65.0%\n−1.3%\n    Tom Brady\n67.5%\n66.2%\n−1.3%\n    Joe Burrow\n70.4%\n68.2%\n−2.2%\n    Ryan Tannehill\n67.2%\n65.0%\n−2.2%\n    Lamar Jackson\n64.4%\n62.1%\n−2.3%\n    Baker Mayfield\n60.5%\n57.8%\n−2.7%\n    Kyler Murray\n69.2%\n66.3%\n−2.9%\n    Jared Goff\n67.2%\n63.7%\n−3.5%\n    Aaron Rodgers\n68.9%\n64.8%\n−4.1%\n    Taylor Heinicke\n65.0%\n60.8%\n−4.2%\n    Davis Mills\n66.8%\n61.9%\n−4.9%\n    Derek Carr\n68.4%\n63.0%\n−5.4%\n    Russell Wilson\n64.8%\n58.9%\n−5.9%\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: Sports Reference | By: Reed Johannsen\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nJones was pretty middle of the road for passing touchdowns during the 2021 season, which may be a shock to some after his stellar 41 to 4 touchdown to interception ratio in his final year at Alabama.\nThe reason being he didn’t have DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle to throw to.\nHis number one receiver? Undrafted wide receiver out of North Carolina State. When you hear that, you understand that he doesn’t have the weapons other quarterbacks have. But this didn’t stop Mac from throwing the fourteenth most touchdowns in 2021. His Achilles heel was that he threw the tenth most interceptions, which was very rookie of him.\nLooking at this year’s touchdown to interception ratio doesn’t make it any better. Mac is the only starting quarterback this year with more interceptions than touchdowns. This is his only statistic that has worsened over the past year.\nSophomore slump? Or is Mac Jones just not fit for the NFL?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(data=diff, aes(y=reorder(Players, TotalTouchdowns), x=TotalInterceptions, xend=TotalTouchdowns),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"gray\",\n    colour_x = \"navy\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=25, y=19, label=\"Mac Jones\"), color=\"navy\", size = 3.2) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Difference in interceptions (blue) and touchdowns (red)\",\n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"Mac Jones ranked number 14 of 32 for touchdowns thrown in 2022\",\n    subtitle=\"Jones threw the most touchdowns out of all rookies quarterbacks.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Reed Johannsen\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(data=diff2, aes(y=reorder(Players, TotalTouchdowns), x=TotalInterceptions, xend=TotalTouchdowns),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"gray\",\n    colour_x = \"navy\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=9, y=2, label=\"Mac Jones\"), color=\"navy\", size = 3.2) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Difference in interceptions (blue) and touchdowns (red)\",\n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"Mac Jones has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns this season\",\n    subtitle=\"Jones missed four games with an injured ankle, making his stats lower than the rest.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Reed Johannsen\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile throwing 228 fewer yards and three fewer touchdowns, he has a 1.2 percent higher completion percentage through eight games compared to 2021. Jones has shown many signs of greatness during his short career so far but has also shown that he sometimes needs help figuring out what to do in routine situations. While you can blame the play-calling this year, Mac throws the ball.\nThe first two years of Mac Jones’ career have had their ups and downs and sometimes been downright confusing, but does that stop loyal Patriot fans from continuing to cheer for Mac? For now, I will continue to support him because he wasn’t dealt the best of hands with receivers, but that could change soon once he finds his groove."

    "text": "Alex Henery made it to the NFL, but not before being a masterclass at what he does best, kicking. And not just kicking it for fun, kicking it and not missing. Henery was so good at kicking, that he is first in every single kicking category when playing for Nebraska. A total of nine misses is all Henery had at Nebraska, eight field goals and just one extra point, where it hit the goal post.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nnu <- read_csv(\"NebraskaKicking.csv\")\nhenery <- read_csv(\"AlexHenery.csv\")\nalltime <-read_csv(\"AllTime.csv\")\n\nkicking <- nu %>% \n  group_by(Player) %>% \n  summarise(\n    FGMade = sum(FGM),\n    XPMade = sum(XPM)\n  ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(FGMade)) %>% \n  filter(XPMade > 25, XPMade < 216)\n\nbigkicking <- kicking %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols= -Player,\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"TotalMade\")\n\nkicks <- henery %>% \n  group_by(Player) %>% \n  summarise(\n    FGPercentage = sum(`FG%`),\n    XPPercentage = sum(`XP%`)\n  ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(FGPercentage)) %>% \n  filter(FGPercentage > 85)\n\nalltimekick <- alltime %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\n\ncareerkick <- alltimekick %>% \n  group_by(Players) %>% \n  summarise(\n    FGPercentage = sum(`FG%`),\n    From = sum(From),\n    To = sum(To)\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    Years = (To - From)\n  ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(FGPercentage)) %>% \n  filter(FGPercentage > 84, Years > 2)\n\nnukicking <- bigkicking %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\nhenerykicks <- kicks %>% separate(Player, into=c(\"Players\"), sep=\"\\\\*\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=193, color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data=nukicking, aes(x=reorder(Players, TotalMade), weight=TotalMade, fill=Type)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2, y=183, label=\"193\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    labels = c(\"Field Goals Made\", \"Extra Points Made\"),\n    values = c(\"black\", \"red\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The highest scoring kickers to ever play for the Nebraska Cornhuskers\",\n    subtitle = \"Alex Henery has made more extra points than some have field goals and extra points combined\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By: Reed Johannsen\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Total Kicks Made\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex wasn’t just a star at Nebraska, he was a top kicker in all of college football. His 2010 season stands out most, when he missed one field goal from 51 yards.\nThe reason being? Blocked. That sounds familiar.\nBesides his one hiccup, Henery continued to kick with extreme accuracy. He was the most accurate field goal kicker when paired with a perfect extra point percentage—beating out Justin Tucker, who is one of the most accurate kickers in NFL history and holds the record for longest field goal ever, coming in at 66 yards.\nSurely being better than the best kicker in the NFL means Alex Henery is a household name himself? Unfortunately not, but we will get to that later.\n\n\nCode\nhenery2 <- henerykicks %>% filter(Players == \"Alex Henery\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(data=henerykicks, aes(y=reorder(Players, XPPercentage), x=FGPercentage, xend=XPPercentage),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"gray\",\n    colour_x = \"black\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Difference in field goal (black) and extra point (red) percentage\",\n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"The difference in field goal and extra point percentage ranged for the top kickers\",\n    subtitle=\"Alex Henery was one field goal shy of being perfect in the 2010 season\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Reed Johannsen\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile 2010 may have been Henery’s best kicking performance, the three years leading up were nothing to look past. From 2007 to 2009, Alex would go on to miss only seven total field goals. After his final season at Nebraska, he ended with an 89.5% field goal percentage and would put himself in first place.\nIf Henery would have made just one more field goal in his career, he would still be in first place overall.\n\n\nCode\nalexhen <- careerkick %>% filter(Players == \"Alex Henery\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=careerkick, aes(x=reorder(Players, FGPercentage), weight=FGPercentage, fill=\"gray\")) +\n  geom_bar(data=alexhen, aes(x=reorder(Players, FGPercentage), weight=FGPercentage, fill=\"red\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=17, y=86, label=\"89.5%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=19, y=87.5, label=\"90%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=18, y=86.5, label=\"89.9%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1, y=80.5, label=\"84.2%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"red\")) +  \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The highest field goal percentages over a kickers college career\",\n    subtitle = \"Alex Henery is third all time in college football history, Nebraska needs another kicker like him\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By: Reed Johannsen\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Career Field Goal Percentage\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Henery has proved over the last 15 years why he is one of the best kickers to ever come out of Nebraska, and one of the best to ever do it. He has only been passed twice in 11 since he exited the college football scene, both of those being .4% and .5% better. Kickers seem to come and go nowadays, and I wonder if Nebraska fans will ever see this type of talent again. For now, I will keep reminiscing about 2010.\nAlex would end up being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the 2011 NFL draft. He then would then set a new NFL record for field goal accuracy by a rookie kicker. In just his second year as an Eagle, he set a franchise record by making 18 consecutive field goals and went on to extend the record to 22. He would retire in 2014 with an 82.4% field goal percentage."
